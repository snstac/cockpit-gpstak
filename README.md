# cockpit-gpstak — Network GPS for ATAK & WinTAK, managed in the browser

A [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) web console plugin for **GPSTAK**, the
Network GPS daemon: feed a sensor's onboard **GPS/GNSS position to ATAK**
(*External or Network GPS*, CoT on UDP 4349) **and WinTAK** (raw NMEA) so tablets
use the vehicle/site GPS as their own position source. Configure the CoT destination
(broadcast to the whole subnet or a single device), NMEA passthrough targets, and
update rate; enable/disable the service and watch the journal.
See [Network GPS to ATAK](https://ampledata.org/network_gps.html).

## Install

GPSTAK ships with [AryaOS](https://github.com/snstac/aryaos); this plugin installs from
the [snstac package repository](https://snstac.github.io/packages):

```sh
sudo apt install cockpit-gpstak
```
